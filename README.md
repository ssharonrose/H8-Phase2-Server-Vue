# Hacktiv8 Phase 2 Vue Backend Repository

Welcome to my Hacktiv8 Phase 2 Vue backend repository! This repository contains the server-side code for the projects and tasks completed during the Hacktiv8 bootcamp's Phase 2 Vue module.

## Description

This backend repository complements the frontend work I've done using Vue.js. It includes server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions to support the full-stack projects I've built. Each directory corresponds to a specific project or task, providing a comprehensive view of my skills in creating functional and interactive web applications.
